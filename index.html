    <p>I was born in Davao City, Philippines. 
        When I was 5 years old, I moved to Lilburn, GA and a few years later moved to Lawrenceville, GA.
        I now currently reside in Kennesaw, GA with my cat. I live by myself, but I love the peace and quiet.

        I graduated from Southern Polytechnic State University in May 2015 with my
        Bachelors of Science in Industrial Engineering Technology with a minor in Business Administration.
        Along with my degrees, I also received my certification for Green Belt Six Sigma.
        Upon gradution, I started working as an accountant for a large dealership. I worked there for a little over a year.
        I was unhappy with my job, so I went on to pursue a career in Engineering, my first love. Soon after this realization, 
        I started to work for Jefferson Southern Corporation in Rockmart, GA as their Quality Engineer.

        My life is very consumed with work, as I am a very career oriented person. I have an amazing life otuside of work.
        I am your stereotypical girl, brunches on Sundays, shopping on the weekends, wine nights, and girl talk for hours at a time.
        I am a huge cat lover, as I currently have one. She is my fur child that's 14 years old. She's a little grumpy, but once she
        warms up to you, she is the biggest cupcake ever.
